## Scoring Methodology

Each of the 18 main criteria is worth a total of 20 points, contributing to a total score of 360 points across all criteria, similar to the degrees of a circle. Each main criterion is further broken down into 4 sub-criteria, with each sub-criterion contributing equally to the main criterion's score (i.e., 5 points per sub-criterion).

To analyze and score a project, a subjective assessment will be made for each sub-criterion based on its alignment with the described principles. While some sub-criteria have clearly measurable aspects (e.g., percentages, ratios), others require qualitative judgment. The scoring for each sub-criterion will be on a scale of 0 to 5, where:

- **0 points:** No evidence or negative impact.
- **1-2 points:** Limited evidence or partial alignment.
- **3 points:** Moderate evidence or reasonable alignment.
- **4 points:** Strong evidence or good alignment.
- **5 points:** Excellent evidence or exemplary alignment.

This approach allows for a nuanced evaluation, combining quantitative data where available with expert qualitative assessment for aspects like 'flexibility' or 'identity'. The final score for each main criterion will be the sum of its four sub-criteria scores.

### Example Scoring for Flexibility (Architectural Criteria)

Let's consider the 'Flexibility' criterion, which is often perceived as subjective. Here's how its sub-criteria can be scored:

- **Sub-criteria 1: Spatial Reconfigurability**
  - *Example:* A project with easily movable, non-load-bearing walls and modular furniture systems would score high (4-5 points). A project with fixed, load-bearing walls and no provision for layout changes would score low (0-1 point).

- **Sub-criteria 2: Functional Adaptability**
  - *Example:* A space designed to easily transition from residential to commercial use (e.g., ground floor units with separate entrances) would score high (4-5 points). A highly specialized space with limited alternative uses would score low (0-1 point).

- **Sub-criteria 3: Structural Modifiability**
  - *Example:* A building designed with an open structural grid allowing for future vertical expansion or infill would score high (4-5 points). A rigid, non-modifiable structure would score low (0-1 point).

- **Sub-criteria 4: Material and System Interchangeability**
  - *Example:* A project using standardized plumbing fixtures, easily replaceable facade panels, or modular wiring systems would score high (4-5 points). A project with custom, difficult-to-replace components would score low (0-1 point).

This detailed breakdown and scoring guidance will help ensure consistency and transparency in evaluating different projects against your framework. The overall profile of a project can then be visualized on your compass chart diagram, providing a clear representation of its strengths and weaknesses across the various sustainable housing design criteria.
